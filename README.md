# Reinforcement-Learning-with-Lethal-Company

In this project I attempt to create a reinforcment learning model to succesfully play Lethal Company. Success will initially be defined as completing a single run, but can be expanded to managing risk through the week. More context and the timelien of the project can be found below.

## Context

### General
Lethal Company is a game released in 2019 in which up to four players, called crew members, explore randomly generated abandonded facilities on alien moons to collect scrap. Players must manage risk as they explore these moons over the course of a 3-day week to meet an ever increasing scrap quota. This mission is made more challenging by monstors that inhabit the facilites. Each monster follows a certain behavoir and players must learn this behavoir. Should a player die and their body not be collected, a fine will be imposed. Should all players die, all scrap on the ship will be lost. This forces players to manage risk as the week progresses. This built in reward model (value of scrap collected) and enviorment to learn leads Lethal Company to be an excellent testing ground for Reinforcement Learning.

## Phases

* Phase 0: Background research and agent development
  * Develop basic agent that can recieve game information
* Phase 1: Single agent, single map
  *  Can the model make a run on a single moon?
* Phase 2: Multiple agents, single map
  *  Can the agents learn to work together on a single moon?
* Phase 3: Single map, with weather
  *  Can the agent(s) apply to a new map?
* Phase 4: New map
  *  Can the agent(s) succesfully make a run on a new map?
